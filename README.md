# Getaway
#### Team Name: Star Carbs 

## High Concept:
Puzzle stealth game where a robber must sneak around police after his getaway driver ditched him.

### Gameplay Description:
Paying as the robber, police search the streets and alleys each level. The player has to time paths of police and move objects in the world in order to pass the level. If the police spot you, the robber gets arrested and the level restarts.

### Detailed Description:
The target audience for this game is mostly a casual experience. It might be more of something that you would see in the mobile scene. The art style will mostly be pixelated sprites and pixel backgrounds which is mostly because of scope. We might have 8bit music and sound effects to match this, again depending on timing of gameplay being completed. As for how many levels, we are aiming for at least 4. If we have more time we will add more. Each level will get you closer to the enemy hideout and the final level you will complete the game. In this sense, the game is linear in nature with set levels and challenges in each. The challenge of the level will increase over time, with different puzzles needing to be solved in order to get past the police. The narrative will consist of a bank job that goes wrong, and your getaway driver ditches you because the cops are coming. Because of this, you must get past them on your own and on your feet across the city.
